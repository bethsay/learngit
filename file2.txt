I dont want this file to be tracked.
All commands in file1.txt were run.
git status says file2.txt is not tracked and is highlighting it in red.
==============================================================================
I change my my mind and will add all files to the repo
	#git add .
I want to see what happens when i dont put commit message
	#git commit
Adding more lines.
Vim opens and tells me to put commit message
I can tell Git to open VScode instead of vim by adding this config
	#git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
	#git config --global -l
	#git status
	#git add .
	#git status
	#git commit 	<<VScode opens up. I put commit message save and close.>>
	#cat .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG
	#git log
