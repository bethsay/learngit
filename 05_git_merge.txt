When merging, 
source branch is must be the parameter of "git merge"
destination or base branch is the current branch.

Continuing the excercise in 04_git_branch.txt, we start of with master and nav-bar branches.
Case1 : Master and nav-bar had their own commits before perfoming a merge. 
            #git branch             #nav-bar and master is expected response
            #git switch master
            #ll                     #index.html and products.html is expected
            #git merge nav-bar      #VScode pops-up for the merge message
            #ll                     #index, nav-bar and products files are expected
            #git log                #The merge is recorded as a commit with a message
            #git lg2
            #git branch
        Now all files and commit history from nav-bar are now available on master branch.
        As all planned activity on nav-bar is completed lets delete the branch.
        Also delete any stale or unused branches
            #git branch -d nav-bar feature bugfix
        Branch Deletion is not logged. 
        Branch deletion also deletes records of it HEAD that was visible in "git log" and in file ".git/refs/heads/nav-bar"
            #git log

Case2 : Master has no commits but footer branch has a commit before perfoming a merge
            #git checkout -b footer         #Create and switch to footer branch
            #code footer.html
                ->footer>lorem10            #Activate this Emmet abbrev in VScode with TAB
            #git add footer.html
            #git commit -m "added footer content in footer branch"
            #git lg
            #git switch master
            #git merge footer -m "Merge footer branch with master"
            #git log
            #ll
        Now all files and commit history from footer are now available on master branch.
        The merge message gets ignored as there were no master commits after the footer commit and before the merge

Case3 : Merge Conflict caused by master and footer commiting changes on same file
            #git switch footer
            #ll
            #code index.html
                ->add some text in <p> block
            #git status
            #git add index.html
            #git commit -m "modified index.html in footer branch"
            #git switch master
            #code index.html
                ->add different text in <p> block
            #git status
            #git add index.html
            #git commit -m "updated index file in master"
            #git lg
            #git branch
            #git merge footer -m "merge footer with master"                         #Merge message gets ignored due to failure
                ->CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
                ->Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
            #git lg
            #vim index.html
        Open index.html file for editing.
        You will find lines that identical stays as is.
        Git will highlight the conflicting lines with seperators
            #vim index.html
                -><<<<<<< HEAD                          #Seperator line added by git. Conflicting lines fount at HEAD commit of base branch start below
                ->change commited in master
                ->=======                               #Seperator line added by git. base branch conflicts end above. source branch conflicts start below
                ->change commited in footer branch
                ->>>>>>>> footer                        #Seperator line added by git. footer branch conflicts end above
        Review the discrepancies. You may keep the content as is or overwrite all of it.
        Remove all 3 sperator lines and save the file.
            #git status
            #git add index.html
            #git status
            #git lg
            #git commit -m "resolved merge conflict that came when merging footer with master"
            #git lg
