git diff is used to check differnce of a file across commits.
    #git diff <param1> <param2> -- <path>       -> param1, param2, path are optional
The response, contains below elements for each file in path
    ->diff --git a/path b/path.                 #This is the expansion of git diff. param1 replaced by 'a' and param2 replaced by 'b'.
    ->index 5975fd4..a94f1fa 100644.            #indexing used by git and the permission of the file
    ->---a/path.                                #Every element of param1/path will start with minus(-)
    ->+++b/path.                                #Every element of param2/path will start with plus(+)
    ->@@ -ln1,ln2 +ln3,ln4 @@.                  #snippet between ln1 and ln2 of param1/path are found to be conflicting with snippet between ln3 and ln4 of param2/path.
    #Lines starting with (-) are found in param1/path but not in param2/path. In git bash, the text font is red
    #Lines starting with (+) are found in param2/path but not in param1/path. In git bash, the text font is green
    #Lines without +/- and in default font are are common.
