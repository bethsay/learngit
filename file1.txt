I want this file to be tracked. So i run
	#git status
	#git add file1.txt
	#git status
	#git commit -m "Add file1.txt only"
I found an warning when running git add. But add is successful and im ignoring this
	LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it
Apparently Windows and git(and all Linux) recognise EOL differently.
Found a fix
	#git config --local core.safecrlf false
What if i edit after commit
